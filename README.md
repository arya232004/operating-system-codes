<h1 align='center'>Operating system concepts</h1>
All engineering students have to go through this phase where they need to code OS algorithms for their term work. This repository contains codes for a certain number of algorithms.
<br> <br>

- CPU scheduling algorithms
  - Shortest job first (non preemptive)
  - Round robin (preemptive)
  - Priority (non preemptive)

- Disk scheduling algorithms
  - Shortest seek time first 
  - First come first serve

- Memory management algorithms
  - First fit
  - Best fit
  - Worst fit  

- Page Replacement algorithms
  - FIFO
  - LRU
  - Optimal   

- Disk Scheduling algorithms
  - FCFS
  - SCAN
  - CSCAN  

- Deadlock avoidance: safety algorithm (also known as Bankers algorithm)

- Memory management algorithms
  - First fit
  - Best fit

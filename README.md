<h1 align='center'>Operating system concepts</h1>
All engineering students have to go through this phase where they need to code OS algorithms for their term work. This repository contains codes for a certain number of algorithms.
<br> <br>

- CPU scheduling algorithms
  - Shortest job first (non preemptive)
  - Round robin (preemptive)

- Disk scheduling algorithms
  - Shortest seek time first 
  - First come first serve

- Deadlock avoidance: safety algorithm (also known as Bankers algorithm)
